## 📖 Overview
This project is a complete, multi-page website for "The Little Taco Shop". It was built as a practical exercise to demonstrate modern front-end web development techniques, including a mobile-first, responsive design and dark mode.

## ✨ Features

- **Dark Mode:** Automatically switches to a dark theme based on your system's preference via `prefers-color-scheme`.
- **Modern CSS:** Built with advanced features like CSS Grid, `clamp()` for fluid typography, and CSS Custom Properties (variables) for easy theming.
- **Interactive Elements:** Includes a contact form, semantic navigation, and subtle animations.
- **Multi-Page Structure:** A complete site with Home, Menu, Hours, About, and Contact pages.
- **Dynamic Copyright:** The copyright year in the footer is automatically updated with JavaScript.
