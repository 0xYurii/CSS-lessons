# CSS Lessons and Small Projects ðŸŽ¨

This repository is where I'm storing my practice files and small projects as I learn CSS. It's a collection of exercises and mini-demos to help me understand core CSS concepts.

## About This Repo

As a first-year Computer Science student, I'm constantly learning and experimenting. This repository serves as a personal workbook and portfolio to track my progress in front-end development, specifically focusing on CSS.

I'm currently following a beginner-friendly tutorial (like [this one you mentioned](https://youtu.be/OXGznpKZ_sA?si=jqHvncs6jMImqo1t)) and building out various examples.
