# CSS Lessons and Small Projects ðŸŽ¨

Welcome! This repository contains my personal CSS practice files and mini-projects as I learn and explore front-end development.

## About

I'm a first-year Computer Science student passionate about web development. This repo is my digital workbookâ€”a place to experiment, track progress, and showcase what I'm learning about CSS.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Practice Exercises:** Small snippets and demos focusing on specific CSS concepts (selectors, layouts, animations, etc.).
- **Mini Projects:** Simple web pages and components built to reinforce my understanding.
- **Notes & Resources:** Occasional notes or links to helpful tutorials.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0xYurii/css-lessons.git
   ```
2. **Open any HTML file** in your browser to view the demos.
3. **Edit and experiment** with the CSS files to see how changes affect the layout and style.

## Learning Goals

- Master core CSS concepts (selectors, box model, positioning, flexbox, grid, etc.)
- Build visually appealing and responsive layouts
- Understand how to structure and organize CSS for small projects

## Resources

I'm currently following beginner-friendly tutorials, such as:
